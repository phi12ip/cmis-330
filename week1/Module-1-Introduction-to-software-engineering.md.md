## 1. Emergence of Software Engineering

In the past the processes used for designing and developing software were very informal, which contributed to the rise in development and maintenance costs. The results of ad hoc development processes contributed to a higher percentage of unreliable and lesser quality products entering the marketplace. Many accidents resulted from failures in computer-based systems with hardware devices that were controlled with software. At the time, the industry was considered to be in a crisis state, which then led to the emergence of new practices and methods in software engineering.

The emergence of new communication protocols, hardware devices, and graphical user interface components have placed a greater demand on software engineers to design quality, reliable, and safe software.
