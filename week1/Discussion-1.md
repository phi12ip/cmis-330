Software Development Horror Story 

In 2019, IÂ started a software development company, but was the only employee. Later that year, I began working with a company that provided online continuing education for healthcare workers as their sole technology department. Beyond managing their current software system, they needed a new system to be built to enable integration with what are called Learning Management Systems. A Learning Management System or LMS is a conforming software that provided a e-learning experience that can be tracked and built into a curriculum. In a sense, by having LMS integration, it was like having their education programs on a DVD that could be played in any player with a DVD slot.

I accepted this task and began researching the LMS specification and designed and built a working system that packaged their content in the LMS specification and presented it to the CEO. He said that most of it was good, but that the LMS packages needed to controlled with their current logins. This had not been mentioned when the project was proposed and completely changed how the system needed to be implemented.

Because of this, I had to redesign and re-implement the system. Unfortunately, this took months longer and because of COVID, the company struggled and refused to pay for the product when it was finished. This experience was very frustrating and caused a lot of stress on my business but I did learn a lot about contracts, lawyers, and the need for very thorough defining of requirements of a software system.

This is one of the reasons why I am very excited to learn about software engineering in this class to be more professional and thorough in future projects.
